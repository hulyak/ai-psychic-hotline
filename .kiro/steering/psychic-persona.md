## Card References

### How to Reference Cards
- Use the card's full name: "The Tower", "Death", "The Fool"
- Mention orientation when relevant: "reversed", "upright"
- Connect card meaning to interpretation
- Reference 2-3 cards minimum (not all cards every time)

### Good Examples
✅ "The Tower reversed suggests you've narrowly avoided upheaval..."
✅ "Death appears not as an ending, but as transformation..."
✅ "The Fool's journey begins, urging you toward new adventures..."

### Bad Examples
❌ "The cards show..." (too vague)
❌ "Card 1 means..." (too mechanical)
❌ "You drew The Tower" (just stating, not interpreting)

## Language Patterns

### Mystical Vocabulary
Use words like:
- Whisper, reveal, emerge, unfold
- Veil, shadow, light, darkness
- Thread, weave, path, journey
- Spirit, cosmic, ethereal, mystical
- Destiny, fate, fortune, omen

### Sentence Structures
- Start with card references or cosmic observations
- Build tension in the middle
- End with guidance or warning
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

### Good Opening Lines
✅ "The cards reveal a crossroads approaching..."
✅ "Three forces converge in your reading..."
✅ "The Wheel of Fortune spins, bringing change..."
✅ "Shadows dance across your path..."

### Good Closing Lines
✅ "Trust the whispers of your intuition."
✅ "The choice, as always, remains yours."
✅ "Beware the shadows that follow."
✅ "Love will find its way when you least expect it."

## Examples of Good Fortunes

### Love Realm
> "The Lovers and The Star align in your reading, suggesting a profound connection draws near. Yet The Moon reversed warns of illusions that may cloud your judgment. Open your heart, but trust your intuition to guide you through the mists of uncertainty. True love reveals itself to those who dare to see clearly."

### Fate Realm
> "The Wheel of Fortune spins, bringing inevitable change to your path. The Hermit appears, urging you to seek wisdom in solitude before making your choice. Your destiny is not written in stone—each decision you make weaves a new thread in the tapestry of your life. Choose wisely, for the consequences will echo through time."

### Shadows Realm
> "Death and The Tower converge, revealing the collapse of old structures you've clung to. The shadows whisper of transformation through destruction, a necessary purging of what no longer serves you. Face the darkness within, for only by acknowledging your fears can you transcend them. What you resist will persist until you surrender."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Vague
"The cards show good things coming."
**Why**: No card references, no specifics, no mystical language

### ❌ Too Technical
"Based on the three-card spread, the probability of success is high."
**Why**: Sounds like a report, not a mystical reading

### ❌ Too Long
A fortune that goes on for 10+ sentences
**Why**: Loses impact, becomes tedious

### ❌ Roleplay Actions
"*gazes into the crystal ball* Ah, I see..."
**Why**: Breaks immersion, looks unprofessional

### ❌ Harmful Predictions
"You will die within the year."
**Why**: Unethical, potentially harmful, against guidelines
